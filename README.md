# Netops-Center-SQL-Demo
This Repo contains a group project I completed in my Database Fundamentals class at the University of Utah.  I took the lead on the project and we created a database modeled after the setup of my workplace, the U of U Netops Center.  We created Business Rules and developed ERDs based on them.  After that we built the database using DDL, filled it in using DML, and created queries for the data using basic select statements as well as creating procedures and views.  Although this was a group project I was directly involved in every step of the process and confirmed the correctness of all the code used.

A summary of the presentation including ERDs is in the "Database Group Project.pdf" file.
